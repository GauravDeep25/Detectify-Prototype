Fraudulent App Detection System
This project provides a robust, multi-layered Python script to analyze Android application (APK) files and determine if they are legitimate or fraudulent. The system is designed to protect users from malicious clones, tampered apps, and apps with suspicious behavior.

üìÅ Project Structure
The project directory contains the following files:

check.py: The main Python script that orchestrates the analysis.

trusted_apps.json: A database of official package names, developer certificate hashes, and permissions for trusted UPI and banking apps.

known_fraud.json: A blacklist of SHA256 hashes for known malicious APKs.

analysis_report.json: The output file that stores a detailed report of the app analysis.

üõ°Ô∏è How It Works: A Multi-Layered Approach
The system analyzes an APK file through a series of five security layers. An app is only considered Safe if it successfully passes every critical layer. A single failure in a critical layer immediately results in a Fraud verdict.

Layer 1: Package Name Match

Function: Checks if the APK's package name matches a known, trusted app in trusted_apps.json.

Verdict: This is a critical check. A mismatch means the app is an impersonator and is flagged as fraud.

Layer 2: Developer Signature Check

Function: Verifies the APK's cryptographic signature against the cert_sha256 hashes in the trusted_apps.json file.

Verdict: This is a critical check for bank apps. A hash mismatch indicates tampering, and the app is flagged as fraud.

Layer 3: VirusTotal API Check

Function: Simulates an API call to VirusTotal (a real implementation would use the VirusTotal API) to check the APK's hash against a vast database of known threats.

Verdict: This is a critical check. A positive match on VirusTotal's database would result in a fraud verdict.

Layer 4: Known Fraud Hashes

Function: Compares the APK's SHA256 hash against a blacklist of known malicious hashes in known_fraud.json.

Verdict: This is a critical check. A direct match with a known fraudulent hash is an immediate red flag.

Layer 5: Heuristics Check (Permission Anomalies)

Function: Compares the permissions requested by the app with the list of official_permissions in trusted_apps.json. It flags any unexpected permissions from a list of DANGEROUS_PERMISSIONS.

Verdict: This is a non-critical check. A warning is issued for anomalies, but the app is not automatically classified as fraud.

‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Analysis
To run the fraud detection system on your local machine, you need to use the check.py script and provide the path to the APK file as a command-line argument.

Prerequisites:

Python 3 installed on your system.

The aapt (Android Asset Packaging Tool) command must be in your system's PATH.

Command to Run:

python3 check.py <path_to_apk>

Example:

python3 check.py /home/gaurav/Desktop/Hackathon/OfficialApps/icici.apk

This will generate an analysis_report.json file in the same directory, containing a detailed report of the checks.

üåê Backend Integration with Flask
You can easily integrate this system into a web backend using the Flask framework. The following is a conceptual example of a Flask route that accepts an APK file, runs the analysis, and returns the results as a JSON object.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import os
import subprocess

app = Flask(__name__)

# Import your analysis script as a module
from check import analyze_apk, load_database_from_file

# Load databases once when the server starts
trusted_apps_db = load_database_from_file('trusted_apps.json')
known_fraud_db = load_database_from_file('known_fraud.json')

if not trusted_apps_db or not known_fraud_db:
    print("Failed to load databases. Exiting.")
    # In a real app, you would handle this more gracefully.
    exit(1)

UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'uploads'
if not os.path.exists(UPLOAD_FOLDER):
    os.makedirs(UPLOAD_FOLDER)

@app.route('/analyze-apk', methods=['POST'])
def analyze_apk_endpoint():
    # Check if a file was uploaded in the request
    if 'apk_file' not in request.files:
        return jsonify({"error": "No file part in the request"}), 400
    
    file = request.files['apk_file']
    
    # If the user does not select a file, the browser submits an empty file without a filename.
    if file.filename == '':
        return jsonify({"error": "No selected file"}), 400

    if file:
        # Save the uploaded file to a temporary location
        apk_path = os.path.join(UPLOAD_FOLDER, file.filename)
        file.save(apk_path)
        
        # Run the analysis
        analysis_result = analyze_apk(apk_path, trusted_apps_db, known_fraud_db)
        
        # Clean up the uploaded file
        os.remove(apk_path)
        
        return jsonify(analysis_result), 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
