Fraudulent Banking & UPI App Detection System
Overview üìù
This project is a Python-based tool designed to automatically detect fraudulent or fake banking and UPI applications. It works by analyzing an APK file and comparing its key details against a trusted database of official apps. The goal is to provide a reliable verdict on whether an app is safe or a malicious clone, helping to prevent digital fraud.

How It Works in Simple Steps üõ°Ô∏è
The system uses a simple but effective three-layer security check to analyze an app:

Identity Check (Layer 1): The system first checks two things: the app's package name and its unique developer signature. Think of this as checking a person's name and fingerprint. If both match an entry in our trusted database, the app is instantly marked as Safe. This is the most reliable check, as it's almost impossible for a fraudulent app to forge a developer's digital signature.

Permission Check (Layer 2): If an app doesn't pass the first check, the system looks at its permissions. It compares the permissions the app requests (like access to your SMS, camera, or microphone) against a list of what the official app should normally require. If the app asks for strange or unnecessary "dangerous" permissions that aren't on the official list, it's flagged as suspicious.

Known Fraud Check (Layer 3): Finally, the system takes a unique digital fingerprint (a hash) of the entire app file and checks it against a database of known fraudulent applications. If it finds a match, it's a definite confirmation that the app is a known threat.

How to Run the System üíª
Prerequisites:
Before you can run the tool, you must have the Android SDK Platform-Tools installed, as the system relies on the aapt (Android Asset Packaging Tool) command to extract app metadata. You can download these tools from the official Android developer website.

You'll also need to have two files in the same directory as the script:

trusted_apps.json

known_fraud.json

Command to Run:

To analyze an APK file, open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and use one of the following commands, replacing /path/to/your/app.apk with the actual path to the APK file you want to check.

Linux / macOS:

python3 proto2.py /path/to/your/app.apk

Windows:

python proto2.py C:\path\to\your\app.apk

(Note: You may need to use python instead of python3 depending on your installation.)

Example Output
When you run the command, you'll get a detailed report in your terminal that looks like this:

============================================================
           Fraud Detection Report for Fake Bank App
============================================================
APK Path: my_fraud_app.apk
Package Name: com.fake.app

Classification: FRAUD
------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis Details:
- Layer 1: FAILED. Package name does not match any trusted app.
- Skipping Layer 2 due to no official permissions data for an unknown app.
- Layer 3: FAILED. APK hash matches a known fraudulent sample in the database.
============================================================

Final Verdict: App is FRAUD
